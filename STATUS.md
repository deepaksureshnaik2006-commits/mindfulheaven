# Project Status

Your project is all set up and ready to use.

## How to Start

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it. The website will be running and you can start making changes.

## What These Commands Do

npm run dev - Starts the website so you can test it
npm run build - Prepares your website to upload to the internet
npm run lint - Checks your code for mistakes
npm run preview - Shows you what the website looks like when uploaded
npm run test - Runs tests to make sure everything works

## When You're Ready to Upload

Type npm run build first. This creates a folder called dist. Upload that folder to Vercel or Netlify and your website will be live.

## Common Issues

Can't connect - Make sure you typed npm run dev. Wait a few seconds for it to start.

Files not updating - Save your file (Ctrl+S) and refresh the browser (F5).

Port already in use - Try running `npm run dev -- --port 3000`

Code has errors - Run `npm run lint` to see what's wrong.

## What You Can Do Now

You're ready to code and test your website. When you're happy with it, build it and upload it to the internet. That's the whole process.
